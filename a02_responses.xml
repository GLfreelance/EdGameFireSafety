			"Don't do that, it might just find you! Let the professional firefighters deal with it. Better to listen to the teacher and evacuate to the designated assembly area."

			"Hide! Fire doesn't play hide and seek. It is pretty good at burning up most hiding places though. Better listen to the teacher and evacuate to the designated assembly area."

			"Ignore it!!! The fire is not going to ignore you when it reaches you. It will use you as a fuel source just as much as everything else around it, so follow the teachers instructions and evacuate to the designated assembly area"

			"Do you ignore things that go bump in the night! I bet you jump! So jump to the alarm. Listen to the teacher and get to the designated assembly area to be counted."
